# mini-wiki

A web application that allows a group to contribute to a central information hub that is centered around one topic. Users must be logged in to contribute. When new entries are submitted, they remain in a probationary period for a configurable amount of time. During this period, users cast a positive or negative vote. If the entry has a positive score at the end of voting, it remains, otherwise it is deleted.
